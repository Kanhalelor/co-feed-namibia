## CO-FEED NAMIBIA

Project "Co-Feed Namibia" is a citizen-driven initiative
whose purpose is to mobilize food supplies and other
basic necessities for distribution to the vulnerable
within our communities in response to the national
lockdown necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic.


Co-Feed Namibia aims to provide a platform for
willing citizens to create an impact by assisting directly
to mitigate the inevitable shortage of basic
necessities expected amongst the vulnerable
members of our community.
